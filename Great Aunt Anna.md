# Great Aunt Anna

These are recipes discovered amongst my grandmother's possessions after she passed. All of them were hand-written on scraps of papper, seemingly by a different person each, but they all claim to come from "Aunt Anna." Not being the sentimental type, these recipes are pretty much all I inherited. Some I remember from my childhood, but none have I yet cooked myself.

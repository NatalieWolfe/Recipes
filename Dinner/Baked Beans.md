# Baked Beans

This is a recipe passed down to me from my mother. Far and away the greatest
baked beans I have ever tasted. The layers of bacon create a rich smoky flavor
throughout and the pearl onions pop with sweetness when you eat them.

The recipe is flexible in ingredients, I have never followed it the same way
twice, but it always turns out amazing. I often use 10-12 strips of bacon in
more layers and split the onions across 3 layers.

The baking phase can be extended indefinitely (I have done 4, 6, and 20 hour
bakings) as long as you check them every few hours and add liquid if it is
getting dry. The longer you bake them, the smokier and deeper the flavor
becomes. I personally prefer the 4 hour baking time just because I am impatient.

Steps 1 through 6 may be done before hand and the beans and reserved water
refrigerated until needed. The cooked beans will usually keep for about a week
in the fridge.

Makes ~3 quarts of baked beans.

## Hardware

 - 1 Large pot
 - 1 3-quart bean pot

## Ingredients

 - &frac12;lb Great Northern Beans (may substitute small white or pinto beans)
 - 2 bay leaves
 - 12 small boiling/pearl onions, peeled
 - 8 long strips of fatty bacon, cut in &frac12; inch pieces
 - &frac12; cup molasses
 - &frac23; cup ketchup
 - 3 ts Worcestershire sauce
 - 2 ts grey poupon mustard

## Steps

 1. Wash the beans and sift to find rocks and dirt.
 2. In a large pot, cover the beans with water at least 1 inch higher than the
    beans. Cover and bring to a boil.
 3. Once boiling, turn off the heat and let sit for 1 hour.
 4. Drain the beans and re-cover them with water at least 1 inch higher than the
    beans. Add the bay leaves and bring to a boil once more.
 5. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Test for done-ness.
 6. Drain the beans and reserve the liquid.
 7. Preheat oven to 325&deg;F.
 8. Put &frac14; of the beans in the bean pot. Push &frac12; of onions into
    the beans.
 9. Put &frac14; more of the beans in the bean pot. Layer &frac12; of bacon on
    top of the beans.
 10. Repeat steps 7 and 8.
 11. Mix the molasses, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard with 2 cups of
    the reserved bean water. If short on bean water, supplement with coffee.
 12. Pour mixture over the beans, adding additional bean water if necessary to
    cover the beans. If the liquid is not soaking into the beans, use a
    chopstick to make a few, small holes down to the bottom of the pot. The
    bacon layers often impede the flow of the liquid.
 13. Cover and bake for at least 4 hours. If cooking longer, check the beans
    every few hours and add more bean water if it is looking dry.
 14. Remove the lid and bake for &frac12; hour longer.

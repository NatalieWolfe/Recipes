# Chicken Adobo Soup

I do not remember buying cans of chipotle in adobo sauce, but there they were.
Four cans of unknown age or origin taking up space in my cupboard. I decided to
try using one on a particularly cold and gloomy winter day. A bowl of nice, warm
minestrone soup sounded great. I had no noodles, and I had extra chicken to use
up so a plan was born: chicken adobo soup.

The first time I made it the soup was way too spicy. An entire can of chipotle
in adobo sauce was too much for me. I gave that to a friend with a much higher
spice tolerance and tried again. This second recipe is the one below.

Like all good recipes, the amounts are just suggestions. Use more, use less, use
something completely different that you like. Adapt this to whatever you want.

Makes ~4 quarts of soup.

## Hardware

 - 1 6-quart soup pot

## Ingredients

 - 1 lb chicken, cubed into bite-size pieces
 - 2 medium carrots, diced
 - 1 large yellow onion, diced
 - 2 stocks celery, diced
 - 2 russet potatoes, peeled and diced
 - 1 cup frozen corn
 - 4 cloves garlic, minced
 - 15 oz canned black beans, rinsed
 - 15 oz canned diced tomatoes
 - 2 chipotle peppers, seeded and diced (from can of chipotle in adobo)
 - 2 tbsp adobo sauce (also from can of chipotle in adobo)
 - 32 oz chicken stock
 - 1 tbsp cumin
 - 1 tbsp oregano

## Steps

 1. Heat the pot with oil over medium-high heat.
 2. Brown the chicken in the pot with salt. Stir occasionally until evenly
    browned on all sides. Remove from the pot once browned. Do not worry about
    fully cooking the chicken at this stage.
 3. Add carrots, celery, onions, corn, and/or whatever vegetables strike your
    fancy to the pot along with salt. Cook vegetables over medium-high to high
    heat until carmelized to your liking.
 4. Reduce heat to low, add garlic, spices, and ground black pepper. Stir
    together and cook gently until fragrant (about 1 minute).
 5. Add potatoes beans, tomatoes, chipotles, adobo sauce, and chicken stock.
    Bring heat back to high and stir. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden
    spatula to disolve the fond into the broth.
 6. Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat back to a simmer. Let simmer while
    covered for at least 1 hour.
 7. Re-add the chicken to the soup and serve with rice and sour cream.

# Lemon Chicken

Another recipe from my mother, this one she says was found "somewhere on the
Internet." To the mysterious chef who originally crafted this: thank you, but
use more garlic. This creates a very flavorful chicken and the marinade reduces
well for a potent, lemony sauce excellent on rice or the chicken itself.

While the original recipe only called for 2 cloves of garlic, I don't think I
have ever made it with fewer than 6. Feel free to vary the amounts to get your
own ideal garlic and lemon amounts.

This recipe does require fresh lemon juice. The pulp from the lemons is what
gives the final pan sauce its thickness.

After step 3, the chicken may be frozen for future use. In the freezer it will
keep for about as long as any other frozen chicken. To thaw for cooking, I
usually pull them into the fridge the night before.

## Hardware

 - Glass or porcelain casserole dish (to marinade in, optional)
 - Large frying pan
 - Small sauce pan

 ## Ingredients

  - 4 chicken breasts (boneless-skinless or bone-in, skin-on)
  - 1 lemon's zest
  - 2 lemon's juice, including pulp
  - 2+ (or 6+) garlic cloves, mashed
  - 2 tbs olive oil
  - 1 tbs whole-seed Dijon mustard
  - salt and pepper to taste

## Steps

 1. In a small mixing bowl add lemon zest, lemon juice with pulp, mashed garlic,
    olive oil, and mustard. Whisk until combined.
 2. In glass or porcelain dish (or plastic zip-bag) pour marinade over chicken.
 3. Marinade chicken for 1 hour.
 4. Remove chicken from marinade, reserving marinade.
 5. Pour marinade into a small sauce pan and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally until
    thick.
 6. Heat butter or oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
 7. Add the chicken and brown both sides. Do not crowd the pan, use multiple
    batches if necessary.

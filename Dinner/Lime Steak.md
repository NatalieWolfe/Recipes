# Lime Steak - WIP
This steak marinade is a work in progress, as such measurements are loose.

This marinade is excellent on any thin steak like skirt, flank, or flap. It
pairs well with [Spanish Rice](../Lunch/Spanish%20Rice.md) for incredible beef
burritos. I recommend leaving the marinade to sit after combining all the
ingredients before adding the meat. In my experience the peppers leach more of
their flavor into lime juice when left for longer. The first time I made this I
accidentally left it in the fridge for a week before using it and it came out
excellently. The marinade also makes a good pan sauce with a little butter and
salt.

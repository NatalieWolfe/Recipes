# Spanish Rice

Adapted from the spanish rice recipe in my old copy of the Joy of Cooking, this
has become one of my all-time favorites. It goes well in burritos, or even on
its own with a little sour cream.

As with all my favorites, the recipe is flexible. I often experiment with
different peppers and use more garlic than is strictly necessary. If you'd like
more heat, leave the seeds of the serrano peppers in, or use a more powerful hot
sauce. Smokier hot sauces tend to do well with this recipe, and I usually prefer
Tapatio myself.

Unlike most of my larger recipes, the leftovers from this rarely last a week, as
I'll eat this for almost every meal when I can. This recipe easily doubles, but
you'll need a larger dish to cook it in.

Note that whatever dish you make this in must be stove-top safe. I prepared this
in a porcelin casserole dish for years by carefully heating the dish slowly,
until one day my impatience won and I cracked the dish by putting it on direct,
high heat. Since then I have used an enamled cast-iron pot that works
beautifully.
